	  This is the core SPI NOR framework which can be used to interact SPI-NOR
	  to SPI driver interface layer and the SPI-NOR controller driver.

	  Unlike normal/generic spi controllers, they are few controllers which are
	  exclusively used to connect SPI-NOR devices, called SPI-NOR controllers.
	  So technically these controllers shouldn't reside at drivers/spi as these
	  may effect the generic SPI bus functionalities, so this SPI-NOR core acts
	  as a common core framework between the generic SPI controller drivers vs
	  SPI-NOR controller drivers for SPI-NOR device access. Note that from SPI-NOR
	  core to SPI drivers there should be an interface layer.

	help
	  Many flash memories support erasing small (4096 B) sectors. Depending
	  on the usage this feature may provide performance gain in comparison
	  to erasing whole blocks (32/64 KiB).
	  Changing a small part of the flash's contents is usually faster with
	  small sectors. On the other hand erasing should be faster when using
	  64 KiB block instead of 16 Ã— 4 KiB sectors.

	  Please note that some tools/drivers/filesystems may not work with
	  4096 B erase size (e.g. UBIFS requires 15 KiB as a minimum).
