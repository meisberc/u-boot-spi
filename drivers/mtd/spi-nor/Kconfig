	help
	  This is the core SPI NOR framework which can be used to interact SPI-NOR
	  to SPI driver interface layer and the SPI-NOR controller driver.

	  Unlike normal/generic spi controllers, they are few controllers which are
	  exclusively used to connect SPI-NOR devices, called SPI-NOR controllers.
	  So technically these controllers shouldn't reside at drivers/spi as these
	  may effect the generic SPI bus functionalities, so this SPI-NOR core acts
	  as a common core framework between the generic SPI controller drivers vs
	  SPI-NOR controller drivers for SPI-NOR device access. Note that from SPI-NOR
	  core to SPI drivers there should be an interface layer.

	help
	  This enables access to most modern SPI flash chips, used for
	  program and data storage.   Series supported include Atmel AT26DF,
	  Spansion S25SL, SST 25VF, ST M25P, and Winbond W25X.  Other chips
	  are supported as well.  See the driver source for the current list,
	  or to add other chips.

	  Note that the original DataFlash chips (AT45 series, not AT26DF),
	  need an entirely different driver.

	  Set up your spi devices with the right board-specific platform data,
	  if you want to specify device partitioning or to use a device which
	  doesn't support the JEDEC ID instruction.
